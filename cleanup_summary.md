# Code Cleanup Summary

## Removed Redundant Code

### 1. Deprecated AB Testing Framework
- Removed: `app/services/evaluation/ab_testing.py`
- Reason: This module was explicitly marked as deprecated and contained comments directing users to use `app/services/experiment/ab_testing.py` instead
- The removed file was a wrapper around the new implementation, maintained temporarily for backward compatibility

### 2. Duplicate Fine-Tuning Implementations
- Removed: `app/services/fine_tuning/bedrock_tuning.py`
- Kept: `app/services/finetune/bedrock_finetune.py`
- Reason: Both handled fine-tuning AWS Bedrock models, but the one in `finetune` was more complete
- The removed implementation was 136 lines while the kept one is 489 lines and includes additional functionality like PEFT/LoRA configuration

### 3. Redundant Directory Structure
- Removed: `app/services/fine_tuning/` directory and its `__init__.py` file
- Kept: `app/services/finetune/` directory 
- Reason: Having both `finetune` and `fine_tuning` directories created confusion in the codebase

### 4. Complete Duplicate Codebase Removed
- Removed: `genai-doc-ingestion/` directory
- Reason: This was a complete duplicate of the main project

## New Improvements

### 1. Common Utility Functions
- Added: `app/utils/common.py` with shared utility functions
- Purpose: Centralizes common functionality like retry logic and cosine similarity calculations
- Reduces code duplication across the codebase

### 2. Unified Run Script
- Added: `run.py` as a cross-platform Python script
- Removed: `run.bat`, `run.sh`, and `run_direct.bat`
- Purpose: Single entry point for both Windows and Linux platforms
- Supports both direct and virtual environment execution modes

### 3. Cleaned Backup and Cache Directories
- Removed: `refactor_backups/` and `.pytest_cache/`
- Updated: `.gitignore` to exclude test cache directories
- Purpose: Reduces repository size and prevents committing temporary files

### 4. Unified Test Framework
- Added: `tests/conftest.py` with shared test fixtures
- Purpose: Provides a consistent testing environment
- Simplifies test maintenance with shared fixtures

## Testing
No imports or references to the removed code were found in the codebase, so the removal should not cause any issues.

## Next Steps
- Run regression tests to ensure functionality remains intact
- Consider further consolidation of utility functions
- Add documentation for the new unified run script
